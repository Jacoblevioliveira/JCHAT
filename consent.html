        <h1>AI Chat Study</h1>

        <div class="investigators">
            <h3>Faculty Supervisor:</h3>
            <p>Prof. Daniel Smilek (dsmilek@uwaterloo.ca)</p>

        <h2>Study Overview</h2>
        <p>
            You are invited to participate in a research study that investigates Generative AI use and determine
            your level of trust in the generated response output.
        </p>
        <p>
            Generative AI platforms (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc...) have gained prominence in everyday use
            and is slowly replacing traditional online web search (Mulligan, 2025). In 2023, one in ten web users
            asked generative AI first for their online search (The Verge, 2023). 68% of generative AI platform
            users use this tool to seek answers to their questions.
        </p>
        <p>
            During this 60-minute study, you will be placed to sit in front of a desktop computer within a study
            room. For each study trial, you will be asked to type in pre-assigned prompts onto the locally-hosted
            AI chat interface, which is not connected to external generative AI models. The AI will display results
            in different output speeds. After each trial, an 8-item trust questionnaire will ask you about your
            perceived trust in the Generative AI output results.
        </p>

        <h2>Participation and Remuneration</h2>
        <p>
            A study sign-up is a firm commitment to the researcher running the study so select time slots carefully
            and if you cannot attend the scheduled study session at the specified time, please cancel the Sign-Up
            or contact the researcher in advance. Failure to appear for too many studies without providing
            adequate prior notice to the researcher may result in denial of access to further studies. Details are
            provided on the frequently asked questions (FAQs) page on your SONA account.
        </p>
        <p>
            Participation in this study is voluntary and will take about 60-minutes of your time. In
            appreciation of your time, you will receive up to 1.0 SONA credit. Additionally, you may
            decide to withdraw from this study at any time by advising the researcher. If you choose not
            to complete the study, you will still receive credit proportionate to the time you spent
            participating: 0.25 credits per 15 minutes, with a minimum of 0.25 credits total.
        </p>
        <p>
            You will also be able to withdraw upon completing the study until the study is submitted for
            publication. Any data that is published will be completely de-identified. If we report individual
            level data in research publications, this data will be assigned a new alphanumeric ID has not
            been used in this study and is not linked to a participant’s SONA or study ID. Additionally,
            after the study is submitted for publication the data set may be shared publicly (e.g., on an
            open access repository like Open Science Framework). Other individuals may access these
            data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset without identifiers may
            be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential.
        </p>

        <h2>Risks to Participation in the Study</h2>
        <p>
            The risks associated with participation in this study are minimal.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you would like to withdraw from this study at any point, you will still receive remuneration in
            appreciation for your time commitment (see remuneration section/schedule above).
        </p>
        <p>
            At the end of the study, you will be given the opportunity to ask any questions and/or raise any
            concerns. You will also be given a paper copy of a feedback and appreciation letter which has: 1) the
            contact information for the researcher, 2) the REB contact information, and 3) the contact information
            for the University of Waterloo’s Health and Wellness Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should participating in this study raise any concerns, you may wish to contact UW Campus Wellness

        <h2>Benefits to Future Research and the General Public</h2>
        <p>
            The information obtained from this research will lead to a better understanding of how generative AI use is influenced by user trust. Specifically, this study will help clarify how different output characteristics, such as the speed of the response, affect a user's perceived level of trust in the AI's answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            These findings will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on human-AI interaction and the psychology of trust. This information may have future implications for designers and developers, helping them to create AI chat interfaces that are perceived as more reliable, thoughtful, and helpful, ultimately improving the experience for the general public.
        </p>

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            Your identity will remain confidential; indeed, your name will not be included or in any other way
            associated, with the data collected in the study. Data will be securely locked and password protected
            in the Smilek Lab (PAS 2247, 2249, 2251, 2256) at the University of Waterloo in the Psychology
            building. Data will be retained for a minimum of 7 years. While we keep your SONA ID on hand for
            the purposes of removing your data should you wish to no longer participate, your SONA ID will be
            stored securely and separately from the study data. Electronic data will be stored for a minimum of 7
            years on a secure, password protected computer protected by the Department of Psychology server
            to which only authorized researchers have access.

            <h2>Participant Consent</h2>
            <p>
                I have read the information presented in the information letter about a study being conducted by
                Monica Tsang, Adrian Safati, and Jacob Oliviera under the supervision of Dr. Dan Smilek of the
                Department of Psychology at the University of Waterloo. I have had the opportunity to ask any
                questions related to this study, to receive satisfactory answers to my questions, and any additional
                details I wanted. I am aware that I may withdraw from the study without loss of any identified
                remuneration at any time by advising the researchers of this decision.
            </p>
            <p>
                I understand that de-identified data related to your participation may be submitted to an open access
                repository (e.g., Open Science Framework) or journal (i.e., the data may be publicly available). This
                data will be completely de-identified/anonymized prior to submission by removing all personally
                identifying information (i.e., names, identification numbers, birthdays, email addresses) before
                submission and will be presented in aggregate form in publications. This process is integral to the
                research process as it allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research. Other
                individuals may access this data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset
                without identifiers may be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential.
