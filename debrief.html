        <h3>Dear Participant,</h3>
        <p>
            We appreciate your participation in our study “AI Chat Output and Trust”. Thank you for
            spending the time helping us with our research! This study examines whether the "flowing type
            output" AI chat text response output can elicit increased levels of trust when people seek
            answers from generative AI platforms.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the experiment, we asked you to type specific prompts into our AI chat interface. As a
            study control, every study participant received the same pre-scripted AI chat response output
            in the mock interface. We only manipulated the speed in which the prompt was delivered on
            the screen. After each result, we asked you to rate the trustworthiness of the results using the
            TAI.
        </p>
        <p>
            We previously told you that our AI chat interface was live and was local hosted in our computer
            servers. We could not give our participants the complete information about providing same
            pre-scripted AI responses on a mock AI chat interface because it would have influenced
            participants’ behaviour during the study that would have affected the survey results. We
            wanted to elicit a more authentic and ecologically valid response with the AI chat interface
            from our participants.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope you understand the need for deception in this study. Most studies in psychology
            research do not involve deception in their designs.
        </p>
        <p>
            If participating in this study (e.g., answering questions about your mood) has raised any
            personal issues or concerns for you, Campus Wellness at the University of Waterloo has many
            services available to support student wellness. Their services are listed on their website at the
            following URL: https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/ or by phone at 519-888-4096.

        <h2>Confidentiality</h2>
        <p>
            This study is being conducted by researchers in the Department of Psychology
            at the University of Waterloo, strictly for research purposes. The association between your
            identity and your data in this study is confidential. Your data will only be associated only with
            your Participant ID number. The information and consent letter provided to you will be stored
            for at least 7 years in a locked filing cabinet in PAS 2247, 2249, 2251, 2256. Electronic data will
            be stored for at least 7 years on a secure, password protected computer protected by the
            departmental server accessible only to authorized researchers. All of the data will be
            summarized, and no individual can or will be identified from these summarized results.
        </p>
        <p>
            De-identified data related to your participation may be submitted to an open access repository
            or journal (i.e., the data may be publicly available). These data will be completely deidentified/anonymized prior to submission by removing all personally identifying information
            (i.e., names, identification numbers, birthdays, email addresses) before submission and will be
            presented in aggregate form in publications. This process is integral to the research process as
            it allows other researchers to verify results and avoid duplicating research. Other individuals
            may access these data by accessing the open access repository. Although the dataset without
            identifiers may be shared publicly, your identity will always remain confidential.
        </p>

        <h2>Ethics Clearance</h2>
        <p>
            We would like to assure you that this study has been reviewed and received
            ethics clearance by a University of Waterloo Research Ethics Committee (REB 46747). If you
            have any comments or concerns resulting from your participation in this study, please feel free
            to contact the Office of Research Ethics, toll-free at 1-833-643-2379 (Canada and USA), 1-519-
            888-4440 or reb@uwaterloo.ca.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please feel free to contact Monica Tsang should you have any questions or concerns with the
            study at m3tsang@uwaterloo.ca.
        </p>
        <p>
            Because this study involves aspects that you were not told prior to your initial participation,
            please refrain from discussing study details with other students. If future participants know
            about specific details, this may affect their responses, thus making the data we collect from
            their study contributions unusable. Moreover, because some study elements are different from
            what was originally explained, we have another consent form for you to read and sign if you are
            willing to allow us to use the information that you have provided. This form is a record that the
            purpose of the study has been explained to you, and that you are willing to allow your
            information to be included in the study.
        </p>
        <p>
            We really appreciate your participation, and hope that this has been an interesting experience
            for you.
        </p>

                During the debriefing session, I learned that it was necessary for the researchers to disguise the
                real purpose of this study. I realize that this was necessary since having full information about
                the actual purpose of the study might have influenced the way in which I responded to the
                tasks, and this would have invalidated the results. To ensure that this did not happen, some of
                the details about the purpose of the study initially were not provided (or were provided in a
                manner that slightly misrepresented the real purpose of the study).
            </p>
            <p>
                I have now received a complete verbal and written explanation as to the actual purpose of the
                study and have had an opportunity to ask any questions about this and to receive acceptable
                answers to my questions.

                    by notifying the Faculty Supervisor of this decision.
